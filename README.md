*"How about a browser extension that randomly turns website images into pixel art of breakfast foods?" - High Seas, HackClub (dino!)*

# Introduction
Have you ever thought to yourself "why should I have to endure these minimalist, useless and corporate images on a webpage"? Fear no more with TakeABreak! Instead of having to endure the suffering of oversimplification, you can now withstand the state of the internet with the automatic replacement of these images with **images of breakfast and food instead!**

You might ask "why breakfast"? Well, you can't exactly surf the internet on an empty stomach, and I think it fits quite well.
